Candidate Correlations
In this section, we will examine how similar are the terms that the candidates use. With the pairwise_cor() function from the widyr package, we can compare the words that the candidates
use, as well as their frequency of use. To do this, we will use the code below to create a correlation
matrix, comparing each candidate. Weâ€™ll also add coefficients of 1 to compare candidates to themselves.

Once the matrix is built, we can use the corrplot() function to visually represent the correlations.

Our results show that there is a definite group of candidates who highly correlate with each other. To better visualize how related this group is, we will use a network graph with edges colored to represent their levels of correlation. The code and graph are below.
