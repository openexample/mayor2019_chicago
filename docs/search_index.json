On that day, residents will be making decisions on the people who will lead the city and chart its course in the face of issues such as Crime, Pension Obligations, and Affordable Housing. The goal of this project is to analyze how the candidates communicate to Chicago’s residents through Twitter and, hopefully, gleam some insight into each candidate’s vision for the city. 1.1 Acknowledgements Simply put, I would not have been motivated to do this project without the book Text Mining with R, written by Julia Silge and David Robinson, and their tidytext package. Most of the techniques used in this document are from the book. Text Mining with R serves as a insightful and concise entry into Natural Language Processing. Along with the tidytext package, I should take this time to recognize the other packages used in the document. tidyverse lubridate igraph ggraph widyr qdapRegex corrplot RColorBrewer gridExtra DescTools tm 1.2 Candidates Covered Below is a table of the candidates for Chicago City Mayor as of January 31, 2019. Included with their names are their present or previous positions. 1.3 Code Examples In the document, I will try to highlight some of the underlying code for the analysis to illustrate how the data were processed. The full code for the analysis will be made available on Github, as well as the datasets used. 1.4 Outline In Chapter 2, we will go over some of the basic statistics involved with the candidate’s Twitter use. Chapter 3 will introduce the word networks associated with each of the candidates. The goal of each network is to illustrate relationships of terms and how those relationships highlight narratives in the campaign. We’ll do the same in Chapter 4, but this time with hashtags. Hashtags can also help convey a candidate’s stance, but in a more concise and connected way. In Chapter 5, we will look at examples of Word Associations. Word Associations will help to correlate issues facing Chicago and related terms used during the campaign season. For Chapter 6, We will take a quick look to see how similar the candidates are with respect to the terms they use and their frequency of use. Finally, in Chapter 7 we will look perceived positive and negative sentiment in the messages the candidates use. 1.5 Data Acquisition The Data were acquired from Twitter through use of the Twitter Developer App and the rtweet package from R. By using the rtweet package, we were able to access the Twitter API and download, potentially, up to the last 3200 tweets from each candidate’s Twitter feed with the get_timeline() function. The collected data were, then, converted to a comma delimited file for portability and easier access. Data for each candidate in the analysis covers the time from their announcement date until the day the data were downloaded, January 31, 2019. More information on Twitter Developer Apps can be found here. "],
["general-statistics.html", "Chapter 2 General Statistics 2.1 Twitter Activity", " Chapter 2 General Statistics Before we delve into the specifics of each candidate, let’s take a look at the activity of each candidate on Twitter during their campaigns. 2.1 Twitter Activity Below, you will see a graph outlining the number of Twitter messages for each candidate since their announcement. Lori Lightfoot leads all the candidates with over a thousand messages, followed by Garry McCarthy and Amara Enyia. Please note that the totals below represent retweets as well as messages from each of the campaigns represented. For some candidates, such as Susana Mendoza and Bob Fioretti, low numbers here may represent the recent dates of their announcements. However, John Kozlar announced in May of 2018 and he has the fewest posts. We can also look at the number of posts by each candidate on a monthly basis. As stated earlier, data for each candidate were selected for study from each person’s announcement date until the day the data were downloaded, January 31, 2019. As time went on in each campaign, most candidates increased their number of posts per month. One notable exception is Neal Sales-Griffin, with a dwindling presence on Twitter since the summer. Another observation is John Kozlar’s sudden activity since the month of January. Finally, we can look at the average number of Twitter posts per campaign day. Amaya Enyia’s activity for January places her first in this category, averaging nearly two more posts than the next candidate. The averages for Bob Fioretti and Susana Mendoza show that, despite their late announcement dates, they have every intention to engage the public via Twitter. In contrast, Neal Sales-Griffin is now averaging only a message per campaign day. Not to be outdone, John Kozlar averages less than half a message per day, though that may improve come February. "],
["word-networks.html", "Chapter 3 Word Networks 3.1 Process and Code", " Chapter 3 Word Networks As you might imagine, candidates often repeat certain words and phrases in order to emphasize various ideas. If they repeat them enough, those words can start to represent a campaign theme the candidate wishes to express to potential voters. In this chapter, we will examine the Twitter messages from each candidate over the campaign period to find and graph co-occurring words. We can, then, ascertain from those connections ideas and themes candidates wish to express. 3.1 Process and Code Here is a (somewhat) quick rundown of the process, including examples of the code used: First, we will take the dataset of each candidate, filter out retweets, then take the text portion of each record and get rid of ampersands, “less than” and “greater than” characters, and embedded url’s. The remaining words will then be paired off in the order in which they occur. The pairs will then be filtered to remove those that contain “stop words” that are not relevant terms for us (e.g. the, an, in, etc.) and extended unicode characters that aren’t words we can use. candidate_big_filtered &lt;- function(candidate_f){ candidate_big &lt;- candidate_f %&gt;% filter(!is_retweet) %&gt;% select(text) %&gt;% mutate(text = str_remove_all(text,remove_reg)) %&gt;% mutate(text = rm_twitter_url(text)) %&gt;% unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = &#39;ngrams&#39;,n=2) big_separated &lt;- candidate_big %&gt;% separate(bigram,c(&#39;word1&#39;,&#39;word2&#39;),sep=&#39; &#39;) big_filtered &lt;- big_separated %&gt;% filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %&gt;% filter(!word1 %in% my_stopwords$word) %&gt;% filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word) %&gt;% filter(!word2 %in% my_stopwords$word) return(big_filtered) } Next, the pairs are counted up and a count for each pair is returned candidate_big_counts &lt;- function(candidate_big_filtered){ big_counts &lt;- candidate_big_filtered %&gt;% count(word1,word2,sort=T) return(big_counts) } The pairs, along with a count of their co-occurrence, is then filtered, only keeping pairs with co-occurrences of five or more. A graph is then constructed, using nodes to represent each word and lines (edges) to represent the number of co-occurrences. The thicker the line, the more frequent co-occurrences. Simple, right? candidate_network &lt;- function(candidate_big_counts){ word_network &lt;- candidate_big_counts %&gt;% filter(n &gt;= 5) %&gt;% graph_from_data_frame() %&gt;% ggraph(layout=&#39;fr&#39;)+geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha=n,edge_width=n))+geom_node_point(color=&#39;darkslategray4&#39;,size=3)+geom_node_text(aes(label=name),vjust=1.8,size=3)+theme_void() return(word_network) } 3.1.1 Bob Fioretti The highest co-occurring terms refer to the mayoral forum and structural change. Also notable in his network are mentions of an elected school board, the issue of property taxes, and a reference to the current Mayor, Rahm Emanuel. Other individuals mentioned include competitors Gery Chico, Toni Preckwinkle, and Ed Burke. 3.1.2 Susana Mendoza Most prominent in Susana Mendoza’s network is the idea of shaping Chicago’s Future. Also of note is the use of “twill” hashtag, short for “Twitter Illinois”. 3.1.3 John Kozlar John Kozlar’s graph is extremely sparse, only mentioning corrupt politicians in addition to the mayoral forum. 3.1.4 Neal Sales-Griffin Sales-Griffin’s network is also sparse and mostly mentions terms related to his podcast. The only notable idea related to the campaign is collecting signatures. 3.1.5 Amaya Enyia Amaya Enyia has a number of different references in her word network. Among the most interesting are references the Community Renewal Society (wearecrs) and possibly Chance the Rapper (chanceforchange). 3.1.6 Willie Wilson Where to begin with Willie Wilson? There are a number of references to local media outlets, as well as to facebook and instagram. Issues referred to in his word network include bail reform, economic equality, and red light cameras. 3.1.7 Jerry Joyce Jerry Joyce’s word network is relatively sparse, with mentions of neighborhood schools and public safety. 3.1.8 La Shawn K Ford Most of the word network of La Shawn K Ford refers to candidate himself. 3.1.9 Bill Daley Bill Daley’s word network heavily refers to gun violence, public safety, crime, and property taxes. 3.1.10 Lori Lightfoot The word network of Lori Lightfoot presents her as one of stye more progressive candidates in the race. It refers to government accountability, the consent decree, the Laquan McDonald issue, as well as social justice, and affordable housing. It is also one of the few networks that refers to the LGBTQ community. 3.1.11 Garry McCarthy Garry McCarthy’s word network refers to a number of subjects, among them neighborhood schools and gun violence. The network is notable for a number of references to the current Mayor, Rahm Emanuel. 3.1.12 Gery Chico Gery Chico’s network is oddly sparse, referring mainly to his candidacy. In addition, references to public safety and his wife. 3.1.13 Toni Preckwinkle Toni Preckwinkle’s word network is notable for its references to unions (SEIU,CTU). It also frames her as progressive, referring to affordable housing and the LGBTQ community. The subject of the school board is also mentioned. 3.1.14 Paul Vallas A significant portion of Paul Vallas’ word network refers to economic development and public schools. Public safety and violence prevention are also mentioned. "],
["hashtag-networks.html", "Chapter 4 Hashtag Networks 4.1 Process and Code", " Chapter 4 Hashtag Networks The use of hashtags also help in forming a narrative and clarifying a stance taken in a campaign. In this section, we will take a look at how each of the candidates use hashtags to communicate with potential voters. 4.1 Process and Code In the dataset from Twitter, hashtags are recorded in a seperate variable, as well as being part of the text. The hashtags from each tweet are taken from this variable, and a similar procedure to the processing of word networks is used to build networks of co-occuring hashtags. However, a hashtag would only have to appear at least twice to be used. 4.1.1 Bob Fioretti Besides the requesite hashtags tying Bob Fioretti with the Mayoral election, there are at least a couple of hastags connecting Toni Preckwinkle with Ed Burke. 4.1.2 John Kozlar John Kozlar’s Twitter feed does not have many hashtags, but the hashtag network still ties him to being against corruption. 4.1.3 Neal Sales-Griffin The hashtag network of Neal Sales-Griffin has few hashtags. Apparently, though, a significant number of them refer to his podcast. 4.1.4 Amara Enyia Amara Enyia’s hashtag network is notable for frequent references to people (allpeople, peoplepower, etc.). 4.1.5 Susana Mendoza So far, the hashtag network of Susana Mendoza is unique among all. She has seemingly tied the majority of her hashtags to the hashtag chimayor19. 4.1.6 Willie Wilson To a large extent, Willie Wilson’s hashtags center on the election and his desire to be elected. However, there are also more than a few of religious themed hashtags, as well as references to the Jason Van Dyke trial involving the killing of Laquan McDonald. 4.1.7 Jerry Joyce Jerry Joyce also seems to have a number of hashtags connected to a central theme: electing Jerry Joyce as mayor. There are also a few instances of hastags referring to the Chicago Bears of the NFL. 4.1.8 La Shawn K Ford Most of the hashtags in this network center on the election and the candidate. The presence of several transit related hastags is unique among the other networks. 4.1.9 Bill Daley Beyond hashtags, there really isn’t much to work with in Bill Daley’s Hashtag Network. 4.1.10 Lori Lightfoot The network of Lori Lightfoot support her asertations as being progressive, with references to a universal basic income, housing concerns, the LGBTQ community, and her possible stance on the TIF’s. 4.1.11 Garry McCarthy Garry McCarthy’s network is unique due to a number of references to the present Mayor, Rahm Emanuel. 4.1.12 Gery Chico The network of Gery Chico is comparable to the others in the campaign. However, there are several hashtags referring to the rights of the disabled. 4.1.13 Toni Preckwinkle In addition to the LGBTQ community and housing, the hastag network of Toni Preckwinkle is singular in its references to the “blue wave” elections of 2018. 4.1.14 Paul Vallas Besides encouraging people to vote, Paul Vallas’ network is notable for its focus on commerce, budgeting, and public safety.

["word-associations.html", "Chapter 5 Word Associations 5.1 Process", " Chapter 5 Word Associations In this section, we will look at words representing various issues facing The City of Chicago, and the terms used in the campaigns that best correlate with them. 5.1 Process In the code below, we will take the text from all of the tweets, get rid of stop words, url’s, numbers, hashtags, and other characters not part of the message of the tweet. The names of the candidates are also removed. The remaining text is then parsed out into individual words paired with the tweet they appeared in. Using the cast_dtm() function from the tm package, the words and tweets are then cast into a sparse matrix. Finally, depending on the term we use, the correlation between the term and the words in the matrix is calculated. The top results for each term is plotted below. The findAssocs() function, also from the tm package, is used to find the best correlation results for terms above a certain threshold. The terms to be examined are the following: TIFs Casinos Police Taxes Violence Marijuana A note about the results: although we are looking for the best correlating terms, some of these correlations may look low. However, when considering the many available words that could appear in the same tweets, a low score does not necessarily mean a weak pairwise term association. "],
["candidate-correlation.html", "Chapter 6 Candidate Correlation", " Chapter 6 Candidate Correlation In this section, we will examine how similar are the terms that the candidates use. With the pairwise_cor() function from the widyr package, we can compare the words that the candidates use, as well as their frequency of use. To do this, we will use the code below to create a correlation matrix, comparing each candidate. We’ll also add coefficients of 1 to compare candidates to themselves. cleaned_text &lt;- on_campaign %&gt;% filter(!is_retweet) %&gt;% mutate(text = str_remove_all(text,remove_reg)) %&gt;% mutate(text = rm_twitter_url(text)) %&gt;% mutate(text = rm_hash(text)) %&gt;% unnest_tokens(word,text) %&gt;% filter(!word %in% stop_words$word) %&gt;% filter(!word %in% my_stopwords$word) cleaned_text2 &lt;- cleaned_text[!grepl(&quot;toni|preckwinkle|paul|vallas|gery|chico|garry|mccarthy|lori|lightfoot|bill|daley|amara|enyia|bob|fioretti|jerry|joyce|la|shawn|ford|neal|sales-griffin|dr|willie|wilson|john|kozlar&quot;,cleaned_text$word),] words_to_candidate &lt;- cleaned_text2 %&gt;% count(candidate_name,word,sort=T) %&gt;% ungroup() message_cors &lt;- words_to_candidate %&gt;% pairwise_cor(candidate_name,word,n,sort=T) name1 &lt;- unique(as.character(mayor$candidate_name)) name2 &lt;- unique(as.character(mayor$candidate_name)) self_score &lt;- as.numeric(rep(1,14)) self_score_result &lt;- data.frame(cbind(name1,name2,self_score),stringsAsFactors=F) names(self_score_result) &lt;- c(&#39;item1&#39;,&#39;item2&#39;,&#39;correlation&#39;) self_score_result$correlation &lt;- as.numeric(self_score_result$correlation) message_cors2 &lt;- bind_rows(message_cors,self_score_result) candidate_matrix &lt;- xtabs(correlation~.,message_cors2) candidate_matrix2 &lt;- as.matrix.xtabs(candidate_matrix) Below are a few rows of the correlations among the candidates, with regard to the terms used and their frequency of use item1 item2 correlation Paul Vallas Garry McCarthy 0.8321599 Garry McCarthy Paul Vallas 0.8321599 Gery Chico Bill Daley 0.8102868 Bill Daley Gery Chico 0.8102868 Bill Daley Garry McCarthy 0.8085491 Garry McCarthy Bill Daley 0.8085491 Once the matrix is built, we can use the corrplot() function to visually represent the correlations. Our results show that there is a definite core group of candidates who highly correlate with each other. You’ve probably also noted that none of the candidates negatively correlate with each other. Since all of them are campaigning for the same position, within the same city, responding to similar issues, you would expect a certain similarity among the candidates. Still, there are notable differences among them. "],
["sentiment-analysis.html", "Chapter 7 Sentiment Analysis 7.1 How we will measure sentiment 7.2 Average term score by candidate 7.3 Highest Contributions to Sentiment 7.4 Top Contributions to Sentiment by Candidate 7.5 Highest (and Lowest) Average Scoring Tweets", " Chapter 7 Sentiment Analysis One way to evaluate the messaging done by candidates is to gauge the emotion and opinion behind their statements. In this section we will be examining aspects of the sentiment of each candidate’s messages throughout their campaigns. 7.1 How we will measure sentiment We will use the AFINN Lexicon, from Finn Arup Nielsen to examine the terms used in the candidate’s tweets. Detailed information on the lexicon can be found in the paper A new ANEW: evaluation of a word list for sentiment analysis in microblogs?, proceedings of the ESWC 2011 Workshop. A copy of the paper can be found here. Simply put, the lexicon rates terms used as being either “positve” or “negative”. The score for each term is within a range of -5 (very negative) to 5 (very positive). 7.2 Average term score by candidate For example, we can look at the average score for each term used by the candidates in their twitter messages during each of their campaigns. The code below with take each term used by the candidates, assign a score from the AFINN Lexicon for each term it shares in the candidate’s tweet, multiply the scores by the number of times each term is used (we’ll call this contribution to sentiment), and divides that result by the total number of terms appearing in the messages. The results show that Willie Wilson is, by far, is the most “positive”, averaging a score of over one per term used. Candidate Wilson is followed by John Kozlar and Paul Vallas. The least “positive” on average is Garry McCarthy. 7.3 Highest Contributions to Sentiment At this point, you might be asking what are the words that are making these messages positive or negative. The following code will extract the 25 words that, from all of the timelines by their frequency of use and assigned score, are most prominent in contributions made to overall twitter message sentiment. This will include both prominent positive and negative words. message_contributions &lt;- cleaned_text2 %&gt;% inner_join(get_sentiments(&#39;afinn&#39;),by=&#39;word&#39;) %&gt;% group_by(word) %&gt;% summarise(occurences = n(),contribution = sum(score)) message_contributions %&gt;% top_n(25,abs(contribution)) %&gt;% mutate(word=reorder(word,contribution)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(word,contribution,fill=contribution &gt; 0))+geom_col(show.legend=F)+theme(axis.text = element_text(color=&#39;black&#39;))+coord_flip()+ggtitle(&#39;Top 25 words contributing to message sentiment&#39;) As you can see, the words “suport” and “happy” are the most prominient of the positive words contributing to sentiment. Meanwhile, “crime” and “violence” and the most prominent negative words. 7.4 Top Contributions to Sentiment by Candidate We can do something similar for each of the candidates. Below are the plots for each candidate indicating the top twelve words for their timelines by their contribution to sentiment (again, score times number of times used). If there are ties in contribution, all tied words are used. One thing to note here is that for Sales-Griffin and Kozlar, their lack of twitter activity during their campaign introduces a higher chance for ties. Hopefully, this will be resolved with the data from February. The results also give a hint as to why Willie Wilson and Garry McCarthy are at the extremes in terms of average score per term. 7.5 Highest (and Lowest) Average Scoring Tweets Besides looking at individual words, we can assess the average sentiment score for a given tweet. In the code below, we can ascertain the average score per term tweet for each tweet in the dataset. We’ll try to take the top scoring tweets, as well as the lowest scoring tweets. In a later version of this document, I plan to include average scores with the tweets. Below are the tweets with the top average sentiment scores. candidate_name status_id text Paul Vallas x1077629743841857538 #TeamVallas &amp;amp; I wish you and yours health and happiness this Christmas.
