As you might imagine, candidates often repeat certain words and repeat phrases in order to emphasize various ideas. If they repeat them enough, those words can start to represent a campaign theme the candidate wishes to express to potential voters. In this chapter, we will examine the Twitter messages from each candidate over the campaign period to find and graph co-occurring words. We can, then, ascertain from those connections ideas and themes candidates wish to express.

Here is a (somewhat) quick rundown of the process, including examples of the code used:

First, we will take the dataset of each candidate, filter out retweets, then take the text portion of each record, get rid of extended unicode characters, and embedded url’s. The remaining words will then be paired off in the order in which they occur. The pairs will then be filtered out to remove those that contain “stop words” that are not terms for us and extended unicode characters that aren’t words we can use.

Next, the pairs are counted up and a count for each pair is returned

[candidate_big_counts code]

The pairs, along with a count of their co-occurrence, is then filtered, only keeping pairs with co-occurrences of five or more. A graph is then constructed, using nodes to represent each word and lines (edges) to represent the number of co-occurrences. The thicker the line, the more frequent co-occurrences. Simple, right?
